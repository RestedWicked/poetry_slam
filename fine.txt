One, two, three, four

Today has a way
Of scarring your eyes
With negative light
But it's a disguise
I put on my shades
And see through the lies
The convenient truth is

Light is on the way
We'll be having a fun time
It's such a lovely day
We should pocket the sunshine
And never give it back
Even if there's a heat wave
Or terrorist attack
It will just be a close shave, I know

I know
That every bomb
Has a silver lining, I know
I know
It won't be long until

Everything works out nice in the end
The sun will marry the moon
It'll be fine
Why don't we sit back mellow again
And have a nice afternoon?
It'll be fine

I go for a walk
The sidewalk is cracked
I'm not superstitious
But I made a pact
With old Mother Earth
She'd get off my back
If I get off hers

Light is on the way
We'll be having a fun time
It's such a lovely day
We should pocket the sunshine
And never give it back
Even if there's a heat wave
We're stalling on the track
It will just be a close shave, I know

I know
That in a snap
All the birds will sing, I know
I know
I'm full of crap, but still

Everything works out nice in the end
The sun will marry the moon
It'll be fine
Why don't we sit back mellow again
And have a nice afternoon?
It'll be fine

Fine
Fine
Fine. (Everything is gonna be…)
Fine
Fine
Fine. (Everything is gonna be…)
Fine, fine, fine, fine, fine, fine, fine, fine, fine, fine, fine, fine… (Everything is gonna be…)
Fine, fine, fine, fine, fine, fine, fine, fine, fine, fine, fine, fine… (Everything is gonna be…)
Fine, fine, fine, fine, fine, fine, fine, fine…

One, two, three, four

Everything works out nice in the end

Sit back mellow again
