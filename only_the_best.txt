She’s wise and she’s kind
She’s tough but she knows how to unwind
And all the lessons of livin’ and the gifts that she’s givin' are only the best

I’m gonna tell you what my momma taught
A thing that she called some food for thought
She’s always wanted what’s best for me
And if she knew you I know she would want what’s best for you too

Through thick and thin, through stormy weather
Together we are stronger
So lend a hand and we’ll make it through
Sometimes we win, and sometimes we lose
But look at how far we’vе come
And you’ll see there’s nothing wе can’t do

Empathy and understanding
Everything she taught me is only the best

Another lesson that my momma taught
The best things in life cannot be bought
She’s always wanted what’s best for me
And if she knew you I know she would want what’s best for you too

Through thick and thin, through stormy weather
Together we are stronger
So lend a hand and we'll make it through
Sometimes we win, and sometimes we lose
But give it your all today
And tomorrow good things will come your way
Good things, good things will come your way

Only the best
Only the best
Only the best
Only the best

Through thick and thin, through stormy weather
Together we are stronger
With hand in hand, we'll be better soon
And like my mother, and like my father, too
I will always try to make the world a better place for me and you
And everyone out there, too
I will always try to do
Only the best
