One place we all call home
It's all we've ever known
There's one place we all share
Everybody, everywhere
One place we all call home
It's all we've ever known

A blue dot in a mote of dust
From up in orbit we see the scope
R-E-S-P-E-C-T her
A new perspective that gives us hope

She's one of a kind, can't leave her behind
She's one of a kind, you know we're walkin' the line
She's one of a kind, you gotta pay her some mind
She's one of a kind, gonna make it through fine

Look deep enough and you'll see
It's like we're family
She's like a mother to you
And me, baby
Her ocean blue and forest green
Like nothing else we've seen

Our home, can't let it go
If you are good to you she'll be good to you
R-E-S-P-E-C-T her
To live in harmony, there is work to do

You gotta have
R-E-S-P-E-C-T
You've got to have it
R-E-S-P-E-C-T
R-E-S-P-E-C-T

Don't wanna hear it, but there's not much time
R-E-S-P-E-C-T her
Can't let it happen, we have seen the sign
Together we can make it better, heck yeah!
